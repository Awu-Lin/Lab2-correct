# Lab2

I ran into some technical issues, my controller stopped working while I was testing it and I tried everything I could to help reconnect it but that didn't work (even I replaced the battery but that didn't work either) so instead of providing a REAL demo in the demo I tried to go into as much detail as I could to explain what I did and why they worked. I don't want that to happen either... I hope you understand my situation and that my explanation in the video satisfies you.
 
**Function Introduction**

This project takes place in a forest. The theme of this project is based on my favorite MC module “Twilight Forest”, where players can trigger different interactions by throwing different colored rocks into the mushroom ring, It's kind of like a fantasy fairy tale style.

**Blue stone**: Throwing a blue stone into a wreath (or a mushroom circle, which has a mushroom in the center) will make a random one of the three trees directly in front of the player simply disappear

**Red stone**: Throw the red stone into the wreath and a soothing music will play.

**Green stone**: Throwing the green stone into the wreath will cause the player to be driven to a location on the other side of the map near the horizontal log, where the player can enjoy the view of the forest and follow the red flower all the way back to the wreath

**Code interpation** 

The code used in this project is not complex and I have added very detailed comments for each piece of code, please refer directly to my comments to understand the functionality of the code. Both scripts are located in the assets/SimpleNaturePack/scripts directory.
